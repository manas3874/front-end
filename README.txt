Hello viewer.

1. The developed webpage is only for desktop (non-responsive), without functionality (no JavaScript).
2. Entire styling is done in SCSS, hence I request you to view the style.scss file instead of style.css.
3. utility-style.css comprises of all the document resetting and utility styles.
4. I have tried writing semantic HTML.

Any suggestion/correction is welcome.
You can email me at tripathimanas98@gmail.com
or give me a call on +91 79779 84255.
